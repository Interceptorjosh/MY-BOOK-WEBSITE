            <h3>FACTS ABOUT THE IGEDE</h3></div>
        <div class="aboutbody">
            <p>The Igede people are a Nigerian ethnic group in Lower Benue State of Nigeria.  They are native to the Oju and Obi local government areas of Nigeria, where 2006 population figures stand at an estimated 267,198 people.However, many Igede people are dispersed across the state and the Nation. For instance, the Igede language is also spoken in Nigeria's Cross River State, and many Igede communities exist in Osun State and Ogun State. The Igede language is a member of the Benue-Congo subgroup of the Niger-Congo language family.</p>

            <h3>ORIGIN: ORAL TRADITION</h3></div>
        <div class="originbody">
            <p>The Igede trace their origin to Sabon Gida Ora in present-day Edo state. They are said to be the descendants of Agba, a high chief in Sabon Gida Ora. A skirmish between the Igede and the natives of Ora led to their migration from that region to present-day Benue state through Nsukka in Enugu state.  This historical event in Igede history is commonly recounted in song and drama, for instance the record and drama piece "Ego ny'Igede".</p> </div>

        <h3>THE BRIDE PRICE</h3> </div>
    <div class="bridebody">
        <p>Bride price in Igede land is called echwuotaba. It has no fixed amount; it can be paid instalmentaly. It is expected that the balance of the bride price is paid shortly before the girl is taken to the man’s house. Good gesture shown by the husband towards his in-law in time of hardship or need is also part of bride price. In fact there is a saying in Igede that says “payment of bride-price can’t be exhausted”.In Igede tradition, bride price is complete when twelve bundles of brass bars is provided which today is an equivalent of N10,000 and above. The amount paid for the brass bars varies from family to family and according to the social status of the family.
        <br>After the bride price is settled, a possible date is fixed when the groom should come for his wife. The arrival of the groom and his people is marked with a lot of funfair and feasting ( Uganyahuonyewe ) in the bride’s house. A bride is regarded as wife only when a gun is shot at least once on her arrival at the husband’s house in company of her friends. There will be shouting (ekwuta jeije, jeije jeeeeehhh!) and jubilation in the groom’s compound. Smoked meat and roasted bushmeat well-seasoned with pepper and palm wine is served to everyone at the reception ceremony.
        We are meant to know that a new wife is firstly camped ( ahu Ojuga ) in the home of her relative living close to her husband’s house at least three days before she finally moves into her husband's house. This is done to settle any complaint between the groom and his in-laws. Eating and dancing is the order of the day, at the end of the day the bride returns to her lodge. The next day the groom’s father hosts both the husband and wife to a big feast and blesses their union. A hen is slaughtered – the gizzard and kidney is for the couple to eat. The meat of the fowl is divided into two equal parts, one part to the bride’s family and the other to the groom’s family. These wedding sacraments depict the everlasting commitment of the couple to each other till death.
        Divorce in Igede land is not tolerated.

    <h3>THE IGEDE TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE RITES, STAGES,  CUSTOM AND THE PURPOSE|AREA|INTEREST|FOCUS  (Groom's Guide)</h3></div>
<div class="traditionbody">
    <p>In most cultures in Nigeria, traditional marriages are usually an arrangement between two families, some times this arrangement may not be the wishes of the two individuals involve. Education and civilisation is changing that norm gradually.Furthermore, in many Nigerian cultures, it is the man that pays the dowry or bride-price, invariably making him head of the family.
    <br>The Igede people live in central Nigeria, Benue State. IGEDE people are from Benue state Nigeria, they can be found in four out of the 23 Local Government Areas in the state namely; Obi, Oju and Konshisha Gwer local government area. Other IGEDE can be found in Yala local government of Cross River State and in Izzi, Ebony State. I.e it has subgroups like Yala's, Takpa's,  and Idele's. Marriage tradition in Igede land is considered a lifelong state, although divorce is possible on the grounds of adultery or other concrete reasons.When an Igede man is at least twenty-five years old and has the financial and physical capacity to maintain a wife and children, he looks for and finds a woman of his choice, who must be least eighteen years old. He reports his findings to his family, which then chooses a go-between, a person who is familiar with the girl's family.
    <br>If you’re a man who is planning to marry an Igede woman, this post will get you familiar with the Igede engagement ceremony stages and process and the customary marriage rites a groom is required to complete. It’s not as overwhelming as people say it is. In this post, you will get an overview of the Igede engagement and traditional marriage ceremony process, as well as see what goes into the Igede traditional engagement list that the groom should take to his in-laws, so that you’ll know, in advance, what to expect.
    The purpose of this post is to give you an idea of what to budget for, when preparing for an Igede traditional marriage ceremony. While this is a guide for grooms who want to marry Igede women, note that the Igede custom requires that a groom is required to officially asks his in-laws to be for the customary engagement list. If your prospective father-in-law is alive, he is the one to ask; if not, ask your fiance’s mother – she knows how to get the list (usually, she’ll ask for it from the elders in the village).
    The Igede traditional engagement ceremony is in stages, but they can be done a few days apart. It all depends on when you (the groom) get the engagement gifts ready. If you’re on low budget, and your future wife understands, you can robe mind together it's matters Of understanding.
    Marriage is the coming together of man and woman as husband and wife to be father and mother to any up-spring produced by their union.
    Marriage rites and tradition among the Igede people in Nigeria is unique, fill with rich cultural practises. Formerly Igede marriages come in different forms; Accompanying marriage, Elopement -running away with a bride and abduction (force marriage) catching a bride of the interest either from road or market before negotiating the marriage rights with her parent. Which ever the case maybe there must be gun firing, telling other intending suitors to keep away from her; the lady is officially somebody’s wife.
    The civilisation and Christianity has eroded some of the intriguing aspects of the marriage rites. However, it has also help in stopping forced marriage. For this article am only going to limit my discussion with the traditional marriage rites of this wonderful people of Igede.
<br>Most times marriage in Igede land is stimulated by a boy or girl’s hard-work and good character. A mother or house wife could solicit for her male or female relation to marriage. She may decide to ask a girls hand in marriage for her relation. She therefore, facilitates the initial contact between the would be bride and groom.
<br>A day is set aside when the groom visits the bride accompanied by his friends, at this gathering the bride and groom are supposed to put on transparent clothing or semi-unclad. This is done for both parties to see each body so as to enable them to have a fair opinion of themselves. Any injury mark on a man’s body could be judged to be a hoe or cutlass cut which means the man is hard-working. This believes; invariably means he can take care of the woman and she is assured of abundant food at home.
Courtship can now commence after this meeting – if the bride is satisfied with the groom. At this point also the groom is always careful, making sure he prevents a situation whereby the girl would prefer his friend/relative to him. There is a gift exchange between the bride and groom. The man shows that he is a good son-in-law by farming for the bride’s parents from time to time. At this point also secret investigation begins, both by the groom’s and bride’s parents – this is done to know if the family of the other side is free from diseases, insanity, stealing traits, alcoholism and what have you. This investigation is also done to ascertain that both families are not related by blood. If, unfortunately , let 's say the groom’s family is not satisfied with the out-come of their investigation and marriage could not hold, the farm work the groom did for the bride’s parents will be paid back in cash, other presents and gifts will be returned also. If the bride’s parents found the groom not worthy of marrying their daughter, they would tactically withdraw from the process.
Carnal knowledge between the prospective bride and groom is forbidden before the final marriage rites are observed. Gifts and encomium are always showered on a bride who proves her virginity on her wedding night.
A mediator called "Oleru" is contracted by the bride’s parents, usually a man through whom all demand could be channeled to. This is after the father must have certified the marriage free from doubts.
