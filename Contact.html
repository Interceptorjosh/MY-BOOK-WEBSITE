            <h3>IGEDE CULTURE AND TRADITION: (A Glance Of Things You Should Not Do In Igede Land)</h3></div>
    <div class="traditionbody1">
        <p>A taboo is something declared forbidden either for its sacred nature or to protect the people of a given community from the wrath of the gods and the leaders. A taboo is a part of any culture in Africa and other parts of the world – largely because it brings a sense of sanity and reverence to certain things in the community. We shall be examining 10 taboos or things you shouldn’t do in Igede land and see how these impact the general lives of the people living in these areas.
       <br> 1. <b>Sex Outside Room:</b> In Igede land having sex outside (in an unroofed structure) is highly forbidden and taboo. It's an abomination to have canal knowledge on an open roof. A male or female of Igede extraction who, for example, had SEX outside room, would likewise incur the wrath of the god, except he confesses, and performs certain rites to pacify the spirits. Failure to do so, the offender dies mysteriously within a stipulated period of usually 7, 14 to 21 days or one year as the case may be.
        <br>2. <b>Committing Adultery Is Taboo: </b>Fornication is nothing in Igede land – meaning that it does not draw the cultural ire of the gods, even though elders forbid that youths engage in premarital sex. But it is much worse if a married woman engages in adultery, and both the elders of the land and the gods forbid this. It is believed that a woman can die for adultery, and a man must never taste the food prepared by his wife if he has reasons to believe she engaged in adultery – or he might be a partaker of her punishment from the gods.
       <br> 3. <b>Suicide Or Killing Of Oneself: </b>Killing oneself or committing suicide is a taboo in Igede land, and so much frowned upon by both man and gods that the victim of suicide must never be buried within the community. His body is cursed and must never be buried in the land, but in the Forbidden Forest or outside the town to prevent such evils from befalling others in the community.
        <br>4. <b>A Woman Blessing The kola nut:</b> Kolanut is considered a sacred nut in Igede land and must never be broken or shared by a woman unless permitted by an eldest man in the gathering or ceremony. A kola nut must only be broken, blessed, and shared by a man because “he that gives kola, gives life,” but never by a woman because it is a life giving nut of the gods.
       <br> 5. <b> Committing Incest: </b>It is a taboo to have sexual relations with one’s blood relations or with sisters from the same parents. This is frowned upon by everyone in the community and must never be attempted by anyone or blindness, deafness, poverty or death might result as consequences according to the elders of the land.
       <br> 6. <b> Using The Left Hand:</b> Using the left hand to do anything is forbidden in Igede land and strictly prohibited – regardless of the fact that the individual may be left-handed. A left-handed individual is trained or oriented to learn the use of the right hand in eating, writing, giving and accepting things. Elders deeply frown on giving or taking things with the left hand because it is considered most disrespectful and unfortunate.
       <br> 7. <b>Unblessed Marriage Union:</b> It is forbidden for a woman to live with a man without the proper marriage rites or without the due approval and approval of their parents. A respectable man is expected to pay the dowry or bride-price of his wife before or shortly after starting to live together, or the woman will lose respect in the community and may face problems of poverty, retrogression, sickness and death among others.
       <br> 8. <b>A Death Caused By Accident (A tragic exit and a bad interment).</b> In Igede land, when a person dies by an accident of any sort, it's termed sacrilege.
       <br> In the past, there were certain ages of death our fathers termed tragic. This is the case of early passage in our present time. Sacrilegious death were seen from;
        <br>(1) If the victim(s) fall from a tree to die,
        <br>(2) If the victim dies of the damaging effect of free radicals (poison),
        <br>(3) If the victim was gunned down.
       <br> Anyway, this was a later development through the white man's technology.
       <br> Summarily, all death as above, the victims were buried in a secluded bush (Forest) area for fear of such tragedy reoccurring. This is because, the Igede burial tradition with regards to such demise, requires that these victims be buried away from the settlements to avoid further calamities. Such a compound, as where the victim hails, is done a spiritual cleansing to avert subsequent calamities of such like. If this is not done, tradition holds that there would be several tragedies of the same as the spirit of death hovers.
       <br> 9. <b>The Fall Of An Elder:</b>  Causing an elder to fall from his seat or drop from his feet is considered a taboo, and the offender must kill a goat for ritual or he may never grow to the present age. A goat or any other prescribed item must be provided to cleanse the land and atone for the offender. Regardless of the situation, a youth or younger individual must never cause the fall of an elder.
        <br>10. <b>Whistling In The Night:</b> It is considered a taboo to whistle in the night because this act is considered to lure snakes into the home, and also attract evil spirits that roam the night. Whistling in the night is highly discouraged and forbidden and must never be tried in Igede land or the individual will receive the sharp rebuke of elders of the land.
